- Replaced the cross product with an iterator. this means
  that any(@these) != all(@those) does not need to generate
  the full cartesian product up front. The prime sieve 
  (demo/demo_Primes) now runs in reasonable time/memory.

- Added comments to the code.

- Shuffled a bit of the code so that globals are defined
  towards the top of the code. This is a maintinence 
  issue only.

- Turned on my friend and yours: strict.

- Replaced naked strings with qw's necessary to accomodate
  strict.
