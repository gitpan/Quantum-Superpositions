              Release of version 1.04 of Quantum::Superpositions
==============================================================================


NAME
    Quantum::Superpositions - QM-like superpositions for Perl

DESCRIPTION

    The Quantum::Superpositions module provides a new scalar data
    structure: the superposition. In a metaphor drawn from quantum
    mechanics, superpositions store a collection of values by overlaying
    them in parallel superimposed states within a single scalar
    variable. Which allows for cool stuff like:

        use Quantum::Superpositions;

        if ($x == any($a, $b, $c) { ...  }

        while ($nextval < all(@thresholds) { ... }

        $max = any(@value) < all(@values);
